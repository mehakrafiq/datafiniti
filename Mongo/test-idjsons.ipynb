using in ear buds to monitor the sound it just wasn t a true enough representation of what i was trying to capture so i decided to look for studio headphones i found these here on amazon and after reading the reviews i figured was a reasonable gamble now to be sure these aren t going to be quite the same level as your average pro studio cans costing ten times as much but i have to admit that these things sound amazing the bass is clear and solid the mids cut through strong and the highs are crisp and clear the stereo separation is great they are relatively light in weight and comfortable to wear thanks to the ear padding they do not have great sound cancelling as you can hear some bleed through from outside sounds the opposite is also true as they do bleed outside the cans somewhat but for the price these things are quite a pleasant surprise they do seem to be cheaply constructed as the housings are plastic but the adjustable headband is well made and the cable appears to be solid it comes with a gold real gold plated painted sub mini stereo plug and includes a threaded to adapter i found this out after spending a minute trying to pull off the adapter only to realize it

behringer hpx headphones the day i ordered the behringer i had just dropped and broken my previous headphones hp pro from jbsystems whilst broadcasting having put them to one side on the desk they fell off and after almost years one of the headphones started flopping about as the thin bit of plastic holding them in place had finally broken disappointed i started searching for a new set and stumbled accross the behringer hpx as a volunteer for the hospital radio a full time dad and a part time employee i was looking for a set of budget headphones that felt comfortable sounded good and weren t too flimsy with the behringer hpx i found all three requirements after much adjustment i found a perfect position for the headphones at which point their comfort was apparent before that i was thinking i wouldn t want to wear them for long periods of time the sound from the start was very good but took some adjustment on my home stereo to balance which gave me pause although when plugged into the desk at the studio the sound was great straight of the bat and the build quality seems to be really good they are very chunky and plastic but where the headphones join to the headband is very solid indeed leading me to believe they are solid and won t break easily don t get me wrong i m no headphone expert at least not in a technical sense but i have been presenting for a long time now and know how i like my headphones to feel and sound and the behringer hpx headphones tick all the right boxestrue the lead is possibly a little short unless you re sat next to the input socket but then again if you want to listen to a home stereo from a distance i suggest investing in a cordless set of headphones for me personally the behringer hpx do exactly what a set of headphones should do and i have no problem with the sound quality at all in fact i m even thinking of ordering a backup set just in case although i may also try another budget set for comparison so i can be even more objective

through strong and the highs are crisp and clear the stereo separation is great they are relatively light in weight and comfortable to wear thanks to the ear padding they do not have great sound cancelling as you can hear some bleed through from outside sounds the opposite is also true as they do bleed outside the cans somewhat but for the price these things are quite a pleasant surprise they do seem to be cheaply constructed as the housings are plastic but the adjustable headband is well made and the cable appears to be solid it comes with a gold real gold plated painted sub mini stereo plug and includes a threaded to adapter i found this out after spending a minute trying to pull off the adapter only to realize it had to be unscrewed lol honestly these cans might not be the absolute greatest but they are definitely worth way more than their price tag i would gladly buy these again', 'just received these in the mail and tried them out for the first time they are perfect for what i wanted occasional use non professional they cancel out all but very loud sounds and the frequency range is really good definitely recommend', 'the headphones are light and comfortable they are not an extra bass or very loud headset however i believe they have a clearer studio monitor sound they are also corded and come with a nice adapter i bought these headphones for my guitar practice with my line set up and they work great i also use them plugged into the htpc for watching netflix and nfl gamepass when the family is asleep for cell phone music playing i still prefer my wired sony earbuds but this is a great tool for what i am using it for with a little more volume and wireless i would have gone five stars but these are by far the best headphones i have ever had in this price point',

the line for what forty bananas the s will do more than most will imagine wide response wide frequency incredible seperation just a thought for those of you with home studios grab a few pairs of these a behringer multi headphone amp and the entire gang will have phones for maybe a buck fifty can t beat that for now i m digging them', 'great bang for you buck they are comfortable and work well for

buying another pair and the pro pair when they are bac in stoc', 'the best smartest choice in headphones these really are like pro the sound quality is excellent lightweight and even an adapter for stereo little larger then i thought but perfect all way round the cups fit the ear perfect don t listen to negative comments these are the best you ll get for under why pay more when you can get such a pro set like these german made is always better thank you behringer', 'you can tell just by looking at them how ridiculously comfortable they are very comfortable to wear produce sound with

headphones but these cans are very short on bass when you listen to music with these cans on there is a lack of bass in the soundtracks if you switch to another set of phones and listen to the same track there is a definite improvement with bass response i don t know what went wrong with these ones but i prefer to stick with my betron headphones which are much more musical than these ones this is my own opinion other people might find them different', 'as an unpaid professional presenter as our head of programming likes to call us for a local hospital radio i have to say i was very impressed by the behringer hpx headphones the day i ordered the behringer i had just dropped and broken my previous headphones hp pro from jbsystems whilst broadcasting having put them to one side on the desk they fell off and after almost years one of the headphones started flopping about as the thin bit of plastic holding them in place had finally broken disappointed i started searching for a new set and stumbled accross the behringer hpx as a volunteer for the hospital radio a full time dad and a part time employee i was looking for a set of budget headphones that felt comfortable sounded good and weren t too flimsy with the behringer hpx i found all three requirements after much adjustment i found a perfect position for the headphones at which point their comfort was apparent before that i was thinking i wouldn t want to wear them for long periods of time the sound from the start was very good but took some adjustment on my home stereo to balance which gave me pause although when plugged into the desk at the studio the sound was great straight of the bat and the build quality seems to be really good they are very chunky and plastic but where the headphones join to the headband is very solid indeed leading me to believe they are solid and won t break easily don t get me wrong i m no headphone expert at least not in a technical sense but i have been presenting for a long time now and know how i like my headphones to feel and sound and the behringer hpx headphones tick all the right boxestrue the lead is possibly a little short unless you re sat next to the input socket but then again if you want to listen to a home stereo from a distance i suggest investing in a cordless set of headphones for me personally the behringer hpx do exactly what a set of headphones should do and i have no problem with the sound quality at all in fact i m even thinking of ordering a backup set just in case although i may also try another budget set for comparison so i can be even more objective than just comparing them to my old hp pro s hope this helps', 'value plus price equals excellent', 'awesome and paired very well with my behringer um sound quality is great very comfortable to wear and noise cancelation a', 'which was and is and paraphrased for the snobby historians among us behringer twice the quality half the cost these headphones are light comfortable and have high sound quality beyond what you d expect for the price i ve owned sennheiser headphones and no these aren t sennheisers but the tremendous value that these behringer headphones provide i believe are unmatched typically i use them for quiet practice on a yamaha keyboard and media music news etc beyond that all i suggest is just listen', 'very well constructed sturdy headphones with solid wire and plug mount comes with handy phono plug as well as the usual mm jack despite the good construction found that the sound was very heavily bass oriented and muffled with a great lacking in top end reproduction as a doof doof reproducer excellent if you want a good range from bass to treble look elsewhere', 'i bought these for my daughter for christmas she is very hard on things and they have survived her handling i strongly recommend to anyone who needs durable headphones', 'so i was looking for a decent pair of headphones to mix with being that it was behringer i thought i d give it a shot especially with the low price to be honest i m kind of disappointed the bass is next to non existent atleast to me even wth the bass on max on my mixer although it has clean crisp sound the mids and bass could ve been alot better i mean my sony s i had before which were around that same price was a world of difference i would ve returned it but to much of a hassle', 'great headphones this is the rd pair that i have owned the ear buds flake off after about years but for the cost that i pay it is worth it to replace', 'had these same headphones and needed to replace them because the audio went out on one side they are comfortable and the sound is very good', 'already stopped working in one ear never sounded very good in the first place i thought from reviews this might be a deal no', 'this was such a waist of time spend a little extra money and a good set the sound quality was very tinny no bass very awkward to dj with as the ear pieces dont swivel in any good way', 'so there is a lot of people saying these have little or no base this is not true they are great sounding headphones for djing and sound mixing they have great mid s and hi s lows are strong but not too loud as to cause hearing damage lows at high levels will cause hearing damage due to spl they fit nicely and are light weight for long term use over all these sound better and fit better then some that cost a lot more i use them for sound mixing', 'behringer is a quality name and these headphones are proof of that quality you can beat the price im no dj or any kind of expert but i do listen to s rock and these plugged into myha mini amp give me the sound i expect to want and need i have a good collection of around headphones and these fit right there do yourself a favor and get a pair of hpx s i guarantee you will be glad you did they are awesome', 'stars for comfort not heavy enough as far as depth and weight more into the higher range frequency which easily becomes distorted with minor volume adjustment', 'for the money you can t beas it all and they look cool so yea it s a winner for that price point', 'pros decent sound looks durable price long cablecons uncomfortable no bass paint not greatother thoughts for the price this is a good set of headphones there is no real bass line but the audio quality is good the paint is peeling a bit but the quality of the set looks to be good i use to dj and listen to music i know some people said you need big ears for these headphones but i have big ears and feel the cups are too small also does not rotate degrees all in all overall for the price this is a good deal and i would certainly recommend it', 'noise cancelling but thats not why i bought them it works', 'i use a w fender gdeck which can emulate a vast number of guitar effects i find these headphones replicate the sounds pretty faithfully and i can make a lot of noise beautiful sounds harmonic or otherwise without bothering the neighbours a longer lead would be useful but for the price they are excellent for the purpose', 'bought these because i liked their specification liked the freq response and their sensitivity which gave me an idea of their dynamic range but also the good looks i had some amplified speakers from behringer called b a truth studio monitors those i bought without hearing them just from the specs and the design philosophy active crossover and bi amplification absolute flat response tweeter wave guide and features i admit i read some controversial reviews about behringer b a some horrible and some very good so it was a risk as it seemed they had serious quality control issues but again i heart other professional speakers from behringer performing live and were stunning sounding so i went for them well their truth made my expensive audio system sound obsolete so i bought those headphones with great expectations based on my previous experience above described and specs i knew they were affordable but it doesn t take a million to make good hifi if you know a thing or two no matter how this is marketed the remaining left to cheer luck was if they were comfortable to wear i didn t go wrong on that either they are comfy and sound very good very accurate with music i had only a few hours of listening sessions with these and have no issues with them', 'i really can t fault the sound quality which is great for the price and fit which is quite comfortable the one thing that i find annoying and therefore sub par is that when i move my head there is an occasional clicking sound from the headset that is quite distracting this may disappear after use but for now it s quite annoying over all though surprisingly good quality', 'very cheaply made almost sent back don t recommend', 'best sounding headphones i ve had in awhile if your into music production these are definitely worth the price', 'exelente me gusto mucho', 'these are a temp replacement for my red waves who s cord shorted out the lack of isolation makes these not a very good choice for a dj the highs are very clear but lacks the bass if you like bass do not buy these while spinning i turned up the cue volume and got a distorted bass this made it very hard to mix because the lack of isolation allowed these headphones to be all but drowned out by my monitor which faces away from me', 'la cancelacin de ruido y sonido son de primera calidad', 'using these is a breeze pretty good sound for the price i m using it for some last minute mixing before the sound is patched to a video camera they re not the greatest at noise cancelling but if you want to get a good idea of what is going into your recording equipment these are very useful in a pinch', 'as a professional musician i have spent a great deal more money on cans than what these cost and i have been around behringer products quite a bit these phones are as good as any i have ever worn including some very very costly studio sets the sound is all there in fact listening to some tunes i have heard a hundred times before i actually noticed things in these speakers that i had never noticed before like background rhythm guitar tracks even at x the price these would be a bargain buy em', 'i won t bother anybody making noise playing guitar', 'the sound quality is amazing they fit on your head well being lightweight they don t weigh your head or neck down i ve purchased two pairs one for myself and another for a family member who is partially deaf and he can hear things so much clearer when watching videos', 'great sounding reasonable comfortable', 'while the headphones seem comfortable and is sent with two size jacks the small one the one most people need does not fit snugly into standard devices only by keeping pressure on it can you hear anything i have requested a replacement and will review it when possible no trouble on the order to get it replaced note the replacement is no better it works with my macbook so i am keeping it but not with any of my hp laptops or desktop', 'hello i normally don t write reviews but i felt like i had to give my you an idea of how these headphones stack up it has a low price and there is good reason really cheap feeling and really really uncomfortable the sound was actually not bad its a flat sound and with some eq you can bump up the mids and bass but overall pretty good sound the issue is not of the sound but on how uncomfortable these things are i mean i wasn t expecting much because the price is so low but at least a little comfort when you look at the pictures it looks like they would be nice and cushy after min of use i wanted to take them off so if you plan on wearing these things for along period then buy another pair i will be returning them hope i helped saved you some time and frustration', 'ive been mixing and mastering music for almost years now normally i use monitors but my new roommates were complaining about sound plus had lost the headphones i usually use so came on amazon looking for something cheaper cant believe i found these as good as they are for this cheap they sound pretty good definitely for the price you can t get monitor headphones this cheap ever and behringer makes quality studio products buy these', 'got these for my year old son he has used them approximately times and now the left hand side has no volume these have never been dropped or mishandled not a good buy in my opinion even if they are low priced', 'sound great', 'tight responsive if your sound is flat with these headphones then check your sound card mixer settings they pick

behringer i thought i d give it a shot especially with the low price to be honest i m kind of disappointed the bass is next to non existent atleast to me even wth the bass on max on my mixer although it has clean crisp sound the mids and bass could ve been alot better i mean my sony s i had before which were around that same price was a world of difference i would ve returned it but to much of a hassle', 'already stopped working in one ear never sounded very good in the first place i thought from reviews this might be a deal no', 'this was such a waist of time spend a little extra money and a good set the sound quality was very tinny no bass very awkward to dj with as the ear pieces dont swivel in any good way', 'stars for comfort not heavy enough as far as depth and weight more into the

very useful in a pinch', 'i won t bother anybody making noise playing guitar', 'great sounding reasonable comfortable', 'while the headphones seem comfortable and is sent with two size jacks the small one the one most people need does not fit snugly into standard devices only by keeping pressure on it can you hear anything i have requested a replacement and will review it when possible no trouble on the order to get it replaced note the replacement is no better it works with my macbook so i am keeping it but not with any of my hp laptops or desktop', 'ive been mixing and mastering music for almost years now normally i use monitors but my new roommates were complaining about sound plus had lost the headphones i usually use so came on amazon looking for something cheaper cant believe i found these as good as they are for this cheap they sound pretty good definitely for the price you can t get monitor headphones this cheap ever and behringer makes quality studio products buy these',

low priced', 'sound great', 'no sound control in headphones i like them they are very comfortable', 'these headphones for the price are great i feel these have a good studio quality sound to them

music', 'great sounding reasonably comfortable wearing for a long period of time sometimes get a little uncomfortable by getting hot from no air flow', 'the headsets feel and look solid but not impressed with the sound', 'i figured with these being newer than the old ones i bought back in these would hold up but it is like the quality of them kind of crapped out i do not understand the point of the padding on them too because with mine the padding really does not rest on around my ears it is more like the plastic speaker housing comes to about of an inch below the speaker comparing this

cost these headphones are light comfortable and have high sound quality beyond what you d expect for the price i ve owned sennheiser headphones and no these aren t sennheisers but the tremendous value that these behringer headphones provide i believe are unmatched typically i use them for quiet practice on a yamaha keyboard and media music news etc beyond that all i suggest is just listen', 'very

but the quality of the set looks to be good i use to dj and listen to music i know some people said you need big ears for these headphones but i have big ears and feel the cups are too small also does not rotate degrees all in all overall for the price this is a good deal and i would certainly recommend it', 'i use a w fender gdeck which can emulate a vast number of guitar effects i find these

that when i move my head there is an occasional clicking sound from the headset that is quite distracting this may disappear after use but for now it s quite annoying over all though surprisingly good

normally don t write reviews but i felt like i had to give my you an idea of how these headphones stack up it has a low price and there is good reason really cheap feeling and really really uncomfortable the sound was actually not bad its a flat sound and with some eq you can bump up the mids and bass but overall pretty good sound the issue is not of the sound but on how uncomfortable these things are i mean i wasn t expecting much because the price is so low but at least a little comfort when you look at the pictures it looks like they would be nice and cushy after min of use i wanted to take them off so if you plan on wearing these things for along period then buy another pair i will be returning them hope i helped saved you some time and frustration', 'tight responsive if

disappoints does not come close to what i think and feel about this product i know you get what you pay for nowadays but there are cheaper similar products on the market that are actually better in if not all most of the aspects you d look for as a user that are far superior in design and quality', 'if i were a professional sound technician engineer i would not purchase these for use professionally

to stick with my betron headphones which are much more musical than these ones this is my own opinion other people might find them different', 'as an unpaid professional presenter as our head of programming likes to call us for a local hospital radio i have to say i was very impressed by the behringer hpx headphones the day i ordered the behringer i had just dropped and broken my previous headphones hp pro from jbsystems whilst broadcasting having put them to one side on the desk they fell off and after almost years one of the headphones started flopping about as the thin bit of plastic holding them in place had finally broken disappointed i started searching for a new set and stumbled accross the behringer hpx as a volunteer for the hospital radio a full time dad and a part time employee i was looking for a set of budget headphones that felt comfortable sounded good and weren t too flimsy with the behringer hpx i found all three requirements after much adjustment i found a perfect position for the headphones at which point their comfort was apparent before that i was thinking i wouldn t want to wear them for long periods of time the sound from the start was very good but took some adjustment on my home stereo to balance which gave me pause although when plugged into the desk at the studio the sound was great straight of the bat and the build quality seems to be really good they are very chunky and plastic but where the headphones join to the headband is very solid indeed leading me to believe they are solid and won t break easily don t get me wrong i m no headphone expert at least not in a technical sense but i have been presenting for a long time now and know how i like my headphones to feel and sound and the behringer hpx headphones tick all the right boxestrue the lead is possibly a little short unless you re sat next to the input socket but then again if you want to listen to a home stereo from a distance i suggest investing in a cordless set of headphones for me personally the behringer hpx do exactly what a set of headphones should do and i have no problem with the sound quality at all in fact i m even thinking of ordering a backup set just in case although i may also try another budget set for comparison so i can be even more objective than just comparing them to my old hp pro s hope this helps', 'bought these because i liked their specification liked the freq response and their sensitivity which gave me an idea of their dynamic range but also the good looks i had some amplified speakers from behringer called b a truth studio monitors those i bought without hearing them just from the specs and the design philosophy active crossover and bi amplification absolute flat response tweeter wave guide and features i admit i read some controversial reviews about behringer b a some horrible and some very good so it was a risk as it seemed they had serious quality control issues but again i heart other professional speakers from behringer performing live and were stunning sounding so i went for them well their truth made my expensive audio system sound obsolete so i bought those headphones with great expectations based on my previous experience above described and specs i knew they were affordable but it doesn t take a million to make good hifi if you know a thing or two no matter how this is marketed the remaining left to cheer luck was if they were comfortable to wear i didn t go wrong on that either they are comfy and sound very good very accurate with music i had only a few hours of listening sessions with these and have no issues with them', 'i must say wow perhaps i have just chanced upon a perfect combination of headphones and partnering equipment but i can hardly believe how good the sound is coming out of these i have many headphones going right up to and these ones must be the bargain of the century these will give high volume and they have the right amount of dynamics and punch whilst staying well under control these have a sound which i could listen to for hours and hours and just enjoy the music rather than scrutinise what i m hearing for me these phones have a certain magic these go much louder than i was expecting from the ohms and sensitivity rating the sound does not break up or distort at high volume or change charactor bass is very much under control and doesnt have a deliberately engineered in bass hump in the frequency response as some of my phones have so the sound never goes soggy and overblown with bassy music but remains tight with the bassline easy to follow as it reaches down into the genuine lower octaves rather than giving an upper bass boom treble is not harsh or brittle either but deatiled and sweet drums come across extremely well especially kick drum and snare the transients in the music are spot on with loads of attack but comfortable on the ear the sound is lean and neutral with a great sense of space and stereo soundstaging midrange is all there but without any nasty peaks however i favour boosting up the bass and treble with an equalizer when using neutral sounding headphones like these others will like to leave the response flat but that is a choice height width depth is all there all that in a headphone costing me only comfort is quite good with little head pressure and lots of adjustability at sound engineering college i remember behringer was a favourite because it is pro audio at ridiculously cheap prices never pretty though but highly functional with great sound still applies i should point out i am using good quality hifi equipment and not expecting these or any other headphone to sound good plugged into a phone too soon for me to say if long term reliability and construction is up to standard my behringer
