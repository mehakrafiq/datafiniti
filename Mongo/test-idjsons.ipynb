always the case the flat design of the cables keeps them from tangling in my purse or pocket the cables feel very high quality since i often use only one ear bud while using the phone the cable

preface this review by saying that i only buy belkin accessories and products for my needs i trust belkin s quality and reliability however these earbuds are not up to par there is a constant static hissing noise in the background that s very very noticeable without any audio playing but also noticeable when there is audio playing additionally even on max volume the audio being played sounds distant and not very loud and the static hissing noise gets even more noticeable in the background i tested these in multiple phones with the exact same results i honestly thought i had gotten a defective unit so i exchanged it for another pair but i had the exact same experience again testing in multiple phones i then got the oem branded earbuds of a major android manufacturer not sure if i m allowed to name them so i will leave it at that and the sound quality was significantly better so overall this is just not a usable product in any way and i m surprised that belkin would release a

there s plenty of bass but lacking in the high range for drum symbols comfort these are actually very uncomfortable because the body is so long if you dont push them far into your ear canal they tend to back out and you lose bass pushing them in so far is very uncomfortable and actually starts to hurt i ve listened to them with them not pushed in far but with any movement they start to fall out
