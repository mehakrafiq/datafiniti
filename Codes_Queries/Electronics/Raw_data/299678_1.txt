off, i would have given it a 4.5 stars if allowed. Pros, it is a lot brighter than expected. Forget about the nits from the reviewers. You must see for yourself watching 4k movies in hdr its amazing and has lots of depth to the picture. Upscaling is fantastic on the A90J makes sdr or hd look almost native 4k . Also has alot of customizations available for picture settings, allowing you to add custom pro 1 and 2 through the calman bravia app. The Google tv is very smooth with no lag an Bravia Core is excellent , could be a game changer. Bravia Core with fast internet works great allowing for lossless audio just about as good as a blur ray disc.The audio sounds pretty good, but would still recommend adding a good sound bar or home theater system for all around surround sound when movie watching or gaming. Features for gaming, has hdmi 2.1 for next gen gaming. A ton of pucture customizations while in game mode. The cons, not very many. If you don't have a room with light control you will notice reflections on the screen. Would prefer 4 2.1 hdmi ports instead of 2. But, there is a work around when a splitter or 2.1 hdmi receiver becomes available. Lack of VRR at the moment, but Sonys says in the works winter 2021. CROSSING FINGERS. while playing in 4k 120 fps hdr, there is some noticeable banding in games that can be distracting. Hopefully there will soon be a fix (That part is why a 5 star wasn't provided). I stuck with Sony even after the debacle with Sony x900h on purchasing the A90J .Now my x900h is sitting in a closet collecting dust with a 4 year protection plan purchased through Sony . So Sony hear me out, PLEASE, figure out the issue with the 4k 120 fps hdr banding issue. The LG c1 and g1 doesn't have this problem. If no resolution then my next purchase may be with your competitor LG. So anyways this tv must buy for movie watching an almost there for next gen gaming . If Sony got creative an added some type of game optimization feature this tv would be untouchable from its competitors. Wish Sony would take gaming serious especially since they do own the playstation division. Maybe they should hire a Phil Spencer type person over there to get creative. Anyways hope this helps people on their decision to buy or not to buy. Good luck and be safe .","title":"Amazing tv with flawed 4k 120fps hdr .","username":"OldManGamer75"},{"date":"2021-04-23T16:16:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-06-29T23:32:52.700Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"This tv is amazing in every way.

So, that means my most recent TV was an LG OLED. It’s hard to believe that this SONY OLED, using LGs next generation panel could be so far advanced. This is a breakthrough. Before I break down some features I can assure anyone using the first few iterations of the LG panels that this one is a huge leap ahead. You need decide if it’s worth the considerable expense, but perfection does have a price. PICTURE: Out of the box, using the CUSTOM PICTURE MODE, and following the advice of a few of the online TV review gurus for a few settings, the picture that results is stunning. Rich saturated colors stand out and contrast that ranges from velvety blacks to almost blinding highlights set the goalposts for the competition impossibly high. You’ll read some online reviews complaining that you really need XXX number of NITS (measurement of brightness) to be really able to exploit HDR programing. Good grief. Unless you want to wear sunglasses to watch your favorite shows the SONY is startlingly bright enough. Shadows are handled perfectly and variations of shade in dark scenes as well are areas of brightly lit sky have smooth gradation, zero stair-stepping, and a range of contrast that can not be matched by most other TVs. ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM: I’m a huge fan of both the APPLE OS and the ROKU OS for managing streaming and live programming. This SONY implementation of the ANDROID OS is very easy to get used to. I can prioritize and reorganize my favorite streams and receive a very easy-to-use programming management controlled by the well designed remote control. Visually and logically, SONY has matched the best TV operating systems out there. Operational speed and fluidity needs some work. The SONY manages my attached audio system via the remote and some eliminates the need for supplemental remotes. The operating system hesitates occasionally and seems sluggish compared to my other streaming OSs, but I’m going to predict SONY will provide some updates. SUMMARY: I don’t think the SONY Bravia XR A90J can be bested by any other TV on the market this year. I’m betting it will be difficult for SONY to improve on this TV’s picture quality for another few years. This may be the only TV I’ve owned for decades where I’ll forgo a professional calibration. It’s spectacular as is. Easy to recommend if you want the best TV on the market in 2021. This is a TV that makes movie theaters irrelevant, unless you prefer coughing, chattering crowds. Sit closer if you want your field of view filled. These Sony XR TVs are spectacular.","title":"Makes visiting the movie theater irrelevant.","username":"TECHBEENGOOD"},{"date":"2021-04-23T15:19:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-24T00:10:38.455Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":3,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"Great for an OLED.

Sound’s not bad for a tv speaker either. It’s everything you’d expect from an oled from Sony. Sony has added some cool picture setting options that really make the picture pop even in a well lit room; it’s very impressive.The bad: First off, no VRR out of the box. Lame. Secondly, I went through two TV’s before getting one that wasn’t horribly defective (65”). The first panel had horrible banding issues along with a ”grid-like” effect that was visible across the entire screen in bright scenes. It’s was incredibly distracting especially while watching hockey. The second panel had the same issues as well as dead pixels. The third was finally acceptable, however there is still a faint “grid” pattern visible in really bright scenes. This seems to be some type of inherent issue with the technology. Not something that I expected from their “master series”. Third, the TV comes in a box that looks like a 3rd grader put together. Not a huge deal, but for a premium price I’d expect a premium packaging. People don’t wrap diamond rings in paper bags...If you buy this tv make sure to check for the banding issues and the “grid” pattern as some panels seem to be worse than others.Aside from the screen uniformity issues, I really enjoy watching movies on this tv.

Especially like the Hi Google facility that allows me to talk to the set to ask it for information, turn on/off and loads of other things, much easier than using the remote.Going back to the tv itself. The picture quality is excellent and gives an extra dimension when watching any program, at times it feels like you are on set with the actors, as you can see clearly all the props and how basic some of them actually are.I upgraded from a plasma to this and considering how large the screen is the difference is remarkable and has certainly gone up in high quality definition.Overall a good buy, maybe a little expensive £3499, but as they say you only get what you pay for. Compared to other LCD tv’s this is certainly in my opinion a much better sound and picture, is it worth the extra cost? That is debatable, but if you can afford it then buy it you shouldn’t be to disappointed with your purchase.The reason for only giving it a 4 star rating is that their are no plug ins to add my old surround sound system complete with video player, and with some old tv, and film shows it doesn’t have anyway of helping to increase the quality of picture in fact it often amplifies the poorness of quality they have been filmed in.

The combination of the perfect black level, class leading brightness, pixel level light control and stellar shadow detail thanks to the XR processor result in the best HDR image ever seen in a consumer television. There are a couple of cons with this tv, such as the built in youtube app does not display the proper color space in certain HDR clips. The auto color space setting gets stuck in BT709 and you have to manually go in and change it, but thankfully this is only an issue with the built in youtube app. Another issue there is a Dolby Vision mismatch with a couple of external streamers such as Roku, firestick and chromecast. However, most external streaming devices and 4k bluray players wont exhibit this issue, as apple tv, nvidia shield, Panasonic ub820 4k blu ray player all have flawless Dolby Vision with this tv. Despite these minor flaws, I am still giving this work of art 5 stars since it currently offers the best available picture quality on the mark, and furthermore, all TVs will have minor flaws or quirks here and there.

The disc is true Dolby signal. I learned later that A90J Sony turns off the TOSLINK connection when it senses a Dolby signal and the HDMI works as expected. Even when using a streaming service, such as Netflix, unless you are paying for a premium monthly subscription, you don't have Dolby.The universal remote feature does work and runs the TV sound to switch to Amp/external, switching streaming box back to TV antennae signal. The Sony TV is a SMART in that Google-TV is the OS. My preference is Android-TV and that is only because the latter uses Google Play-Store -- more apps available including foreign-language news apps, games, etc. Besides, my streaming box is the Nvidia Shield and it enhances the picture on the Sony TV a small bit because the streaming box upscales if it can.I'll let the other reviews rave about the picture. I like it too. I like that I bought a Sony appliance that works great with Sony AVR and other brand products. Less","title":"Sony -- The One and Only (as the ad used to say)","username":"sweetThang · Review provided by  bestbuy.com"},{"date":"2021-05-02T19:20:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-27T12:30:10.566Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":11,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"I absolutely love love love this TV.

My non-techy friends could immediately tell that this TV was something out of the ordinary. Even without my explaining the ‘surface’ audio system they all commented how good it sounded with the volume on low levels (5-20 vol). Everyone so far, have mentioned how good the TV looked when viewed from the side and that at times the ‘black’ was so good that the A90J appeared as though it had been switched off during movie cut-scenes.Removing the TV from the carton single handed was a lot easier than I expected as was getting it onto a TV stand such is the light weight compared to older LED TV’s of the same screen size. Setup took me less than 15 minutes. I simply plugged in an ethernet cable into the A90J from my router and was connected to the internet right away. I later purchased a USB 3 to ethernet adapter (branded Cable Matters from Amazon) that raised the A90J’s connection speed from the standard 100MBPs theoretical maximum to over 800MBPs so as to guarantee no buffering when streaming. I selected ‘Custom’ as the picture mode, turned down the brightness to around 40 and have been satisfied with the results whether in daylight or darkness. The addition of the Bravia Core app was very welcome as there are a few IMAX enhanced movies available to show off the A90J’s image quality.I purchased this TV in its second year of availability so all the updates had been applied and it wasn’t missing any features. Lastly my favourite feature is the remote which handily has illuminated keys in the dark when it is moved or picked up.I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a great OLED TV. Less","title":"Great TV that contiunues to amaze","username":"Floydy · Review provided by  sony.co.uk"},{"date":"2021-03-26T15:07:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-24T00:10:38.451Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":5,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"Best TV I have bought yet!!

I had my eye on this tv for a very long time and had very high expectations going into it. This tv replaced a 16 year old 37” Panasonic plasma, which was an amazing tv to this day, but felt it was time for an upgrade. So here is my evaluation on this tv after owning it for one week. Design: I decided to mount this tv on the wall and it looks spectacular. There is a very small bezel that goes around the screen. It is also very thin. The design was well thought of and even when the tv isn’t on, it looks beautiful. Connectivity: I wanted to get the best connection I could get for this tv so I bought a high end Ethernet cable. I noticed that the picture wasn’t all that great. Come to find out that this tv has a 10/100 Ethernet port. I was a bit surprised as the standard today is 10/100/1000. Once I connected it to the 5Ghz network on my wireless modem, I could tell the picture was much better. Sound: the sound on this tv is really good. It states that the sound is supposed to be immersive and 3D surround, but I’m not getting that. Maybe I have the sound settings wrong, but I don’t get a surround sound feeling like you’d get from a sound bar or external speakers. Regardless, the sound is still amazing. Picture quality: this is where the tv shines. It took awhile to get the picture settings right, but once I did, the picture on this tv is crazy! I am a perfectionist and I tried very hard to find imperfections and I just couldn’t. The tv can get very bright. I was concerned about burn in, but I can’t even find image retention as compared to my previous plasma. The picture is extremely sharp. 4K and ultraHD is mind blowing. At times, the picture looks 3D. Colors pop out of the screen and makes you feel you are right there. Motion was a bit of an issue, but after I turned it off, it seemed to improve a great deal. You can get lost in the settings, but once you get them set to how you like it, the TV really is exceptional. Cost: this tv is expensive and it really comes down to how much you want to spend on a tv. It comes down to what you can afford and what your budget is. Personally, I saved up for this tv so I knew I was going to spend this much going in. Plus, I look at this as an investment as I expect to keep this tv for at least 10, if not 15 years. When I bought my 37” plasma 16 years ago, it cost $2,000. At that time, you had to be rich to afford an oled. It would’ve cost you $10,000-$15,000 for a 55” oled at that time. Today, the technology is way better. Again, it comes down to how much you want to spend. However, if you want the best of the best, then this is the tv. As I said earlier, I had very high expectations for this tv and it didn’t disappoint. It not only met them, but went above and beyond. After some tweaking, this tv is truly spectacular! Believe the hype, this tv is all that, plus more. Don’t take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Be ready to be blown away!","title":"A gem!!!","username":"Godis1"},{"date":"2021-04-09T16:34:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-04-10T12:45:52.246Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"The software/firmware in this TV is not ready for shipment.

The issue was escalated to Sony level three support, but their advice of consenting to Sony Smart TV services in the Privacy Policy, restarting the TV, waiting two hours, and trying again did not resolve the issue. That section of the Privacy Policy only mentions DRM and does not give any indication that it's required for Apple services. If consent is a problem, then the TV should display that information instead of trying to initiate a connection. It's clear that Sony's software quality assurance (QA) and testing regime falls far short for a product this expensive. To top it off, level three support refused to set a time to meet with me.

So, that means my most recent TV was an LG OLED. It’s hard to believe that this SONY OLED, using LGs next generation panel could be so far advanced. This is a breakthrough. Before I break down some features I can assure anyone using the first few iterations of the LG panels that this one is a huge leap ahead. You need decide if it’s worth the considerable expense, but perfection does have a price.PICTURE: Out of the box, using the CUSTOM PICTURE MODE, and following the advice of a few of the online TV review gurus for a few settings, the picture that results is stunning. Rich saturated colors stand out and contrast that ranges from velvety blacks to almost blinding highlights set the goalposts for the competition impossibly high. You’ll read some online reviews complaining that you really need XXX number of NITS (measurement of brightness) to be really able to exploit HDR programing. Good grief. Unless you want to wear sunglasses to watch your favorite shows the SONY is startlingly bright enough. Shadows are handled perfectly and variations of shade in dark scenes as well are areas of brightly lit sky have smooth gradation, zero stair-stepping, and a range of contrast that can not be matched by most other TVs.ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM: I’m a huge fan of both the APPLE OS and the ROKU OS for managing streaming and live programming. This SONY implementation of the ANDROID OS is very easy to get used to. I can prioritize and reorganize my favorite streams and receive a very easy-to-use programming management controlled by the well designed remote control. Visually and logically, SONY has matched the best TV operating systems out there. Operational speed and fluidity needs some work.The SONY manages my attached audio system via the remote and some eliminates the need for supplemental remotes. The operating system hesitates occasionally and seems sluggish compared to my other streaming OSs, but I’m going to predict SONY will provide some updates.SUMMARY: I don’t think the SONY Bravia XR A90J can be bested by any other TV on the market this year. I’m betting it will be difficult for SONY to improve on this TV’s picture quality for another few years. This may be the only TV I’ve owned for decades where I’ll forgo a professional calibration. It’s spectacular as is. Easy to recommend if you want the best TV on the market in 2021. This is a TV that makes movie theaters irrelevant, unless you prefer coughing, chattering crowds. Sit closer if you want your field of view filled. These Sony XR TVs are spectacular. Less","title":"Makes visiting the movie theater irrelevant.","username":"TECHBEENGOOD · Review provided by  Best Buy"},{"date":"2021-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-25T21:12:00.000Z","rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1617365-REG/sony_xr65a90j_bravia_xr_master_series.html"],"text":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an exceptional piece of technology.

Features for gaming, has hdmi 2.1 for next gen gaming. A ton of pucture customizations while in game mode. The cons, not very many. If you don't have a room with light control you will notice reflections on the screen. Would prefer 4 2.1 hdmi ports instead of 2. But, there is a work around when a splitter or 2.1 hdmi receiver becomes available. Lack of VRR at the moment, but Sonys says in the works winter 2021. CROSSING FINGERS. while playing in 4k 120 fps hdr, there is some noticeable banding in games that can be distracting. Hopefully there will soon be a fix (That part is why a 5 star wasn't provided). I stuck with Sony even after the debacle with Sony x900h on purchasing the A90J .Now my x900h is sitting in a closet collecting dust with a 4 year protection plan purchased through Sony . So Sony hear me out, PLEASE, figure out the issue with the 4k 120 fps hdr banding issue. The LG c1 and g1 doesn't have this problem. If no resolution then my next purchase may be with your competitor LG. So anyways this tv must buy for movie watching an almost there for next gen gaming . If Sony got creative an added some type of game optimization feature this tv would be untouchable from its competitors. Wish Sony would take gaming serious especially since they do own the playstation division. Maybe they should hire a Phil Spencer type person over there to get creative.

Most people will say get an external box but there are other issues beyond that. i keep getting notifications to setup an external device on the HDMI port after i have already done it eg a Fire TV cube. It seems to have a bug which makes the TV forget devices connected to the TV. The TV is very aggressive with its dimming algorithm, 4k HDR Movies start out much brighter than my C9 but after 5 mins they equalize in brightness levels, I have disable energy saving and turned off all power saving options but it appears the Sony is terrified of Burn in even though this TV has a heatsink, you would think Sony would let the TV breathe and flex it muscles. I have a vizio elevate sound bar and its seems to have handshake issues with the A90j TV just like the C9 also. The A90J works better with the vizio elevate and gives me fewer headaches than the C9. I am not sure what is responsible for the sound issues whether its d TV or the soundbar. When you watch a 4k HDR dolby vision movie, the A90j looks incredible. The colors are natural and not over done, images have depth. My jaw dropped when i watched Doctor Strange 2 Imax enhanced on disney+ on the A90j, The C9 wasn't close. I will recommend the TV due to the amazing picture quality but Sony has fix the HDMI port bug and allow the TV to show off the brightness by relaxing the ABL not just in vivid mode. I was looking at getting the Samsung s95b which looked brighter and punchier in the store demo mode at best buy but I just cant do w/o Dolby vision. The ATSC 3.0 tv tuner requires a really strong signal to receive tv channels on an antennae. it tends to buffer for a couple of seconds when i change channels. If you live close to the towers then this shouldn't be a problem. The upscaling is better than the C9 for 1080p content, it is basically tied for 720p and 480p content, there is so much a Tv can do at such low resolution. The A90j is a noticeably better TV than the C9 if anyone was thinking about upgrading. The only 2 areas i prefer the Lg C9 is the web os and Lg is better at recognizing devices connected to the HDMI ports. Less","title":"Great picture...Buggy/glitchy Software( AndroidTV)","username":"akin6172 · Review provided by  bestbuy.com"},{"date":"2021-04-16T21:37:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-05-04T18:53:29.971Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"I just had to have it.

Wall mounting was easy with an off the shelf bracket as well. The ports available are what is required. 2 hdmi 2.1 port are provided for 4k120 signals from ps5 and with the latest update, VRR has been activated. The one downside to the ports is the ethernet socket. It is not a gigabit port so is limited to 100mbps. The WiFi on the other is much faster and there is also a usb 3.0 port so a usb to ethernet adapter can be used to get full gigabit wired ethernet.All in all I can not fault the set.

While I don't understand why, on my old Sony TV, the sound through my AV system (not a cheap system) was almost unlistenable. Voices were garbled and muddled with the background sound. On this TV it is very clear. I would have thought the eARC was a faithful, unprocessed digital stream, but the difference between this new Sony and my old one is night and day. A pleasant and unexpected surprise. I did have trouble connecting to a hardwired ethernet cable. Not sure what the problem was, but Sony customer service was very helpful and patient in trying to resolve the issue, even to the point of offering to exchange the TV. In desperation, I tried the same thing I tried 3 or 4 times before and it worked. I have noticed that physically disconnecting and reconnecting the ethernet cable is problematic, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I initially chalked this up to issues with the connector, but I tried at 3 different cables that all were working with my old setup and the same cables sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. However once connected I've not had a problem; it does maintain the connection. My biggest criticism is with the remote. I could quibble about the button placement. The mute button is tiny, something use we a lot, There are no page buttons, so scrolling 1 item at a time is tedious. These are design trade-offs, so I understand you can't have every thing. But the real issue is the extreme directionality of the IR. Off axis by 30-45 degrees and it is unresponsive. Contrast this with the XFINITY remote which works in almost any place in the room and pointed in almost any random direction. I am going to try adding an IR blaster, but the XFINITY remote shows this can be done without extra junk.","title":"Fantastic TV, Quibbles with the Remote","username":"JimR"},{"date":"2021-05-28T15:17:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-27T12:30:10.578Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":2,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"This tv is THE best i have ever owned crystal clear picture and quality thank you Sony you nailed this one on the head!!!!","title":"The best oled on the market","username":"Great"},{"date":"2021-04-13T10:39:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-05-01T13:39:12.624Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":6,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"I'm aware of the praise this television is getting, but that just hasn't been my experience.

I have noticed that physically disconnecting and reconnecting the ethernet cable is problematic, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I initially chalked this up to issues with the connector, but I tried at 3 different cables that all were working with my old setup and the same cables sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. However once connected I've not had a problem; it does maintain the connection.My biggest criticism is with the remote. I could quibble about the button placement. The mute button is tiny, something use we a lot, There are no page buttons, so scrolling 1 item at a time is tedious. These are design trade-offs, so I understand you can't have every thing. But the real issue is the extreme directionality of the IR. Off axis by 30-45 degrees and it is unresponsive. Contrast this with the XFINITY remote which works in almost any place in the room and pointed in almost any random direction. I am going to try adding an IR blaster, but the XFINITY remote shows this can be done without extra junk. Less","title":"Fantastic TV, Quibbles with the Remote","username":"JimR · Review provided by  Best Buy"},{"date":"2021-07-15T13:48:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-24T00:10:38.461Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"I went into the Best Buy store in Crystal Lake to look at 65\" Samsung TVs.

Motion resolution and motion processing are the best in the business. Gaming on this TV is where it’s at. PlayStation 5 games look amazing on the A90J. The only two things that need improving is the Google TV interface and the available number of HDMI 2.1 ports. Google TV is kinda clunky and it has way too many ads. I’m sure it can be improved with software updates. The set has only two HDMI 2.1 one ports (one is the eARC port), with the other two being HDMI 2.0b ports.

So, that means my most recent TV was an LG OLED. It’s hard to believe that this SONY OLED, using LGs next generation panel could be so far advanced. This is a breakthrough. Before I break down some features I can assure anyone using the first few iterations of the LG panels that this one is a huge leap ahead. You need decide if it’s worth the considerable expense, but perfection does have a price.PICTURE: Out of the box, using the CUSTOM PICTURE MODE, and following the advice of a few of the online TV review gurus for a few settings, the picture that results is stunning. Rich saturated colors stand out and contrast that ranges from velvety blacks to almost blinding highlights set the goalposts for the competition impossibly high. You’ll read some online reviews complaining that you really need XXX number of NITS (measurement of brightness) to be really able to exploit HDR programing. Good grief. Unless you want to wear sunglasses to watch your favorite shows the SONY is startlingly bright enough. Shadows are handled perfectly and variations of shade in dark scenes as well are areas of brightly lit sky have smooth gradation, zero stair-stepping, and a range of contrast that can not be matched by most other TVs.ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM: I’m a huge fan of both the APPLE OS and the ROKU OS for managing streaming and live programming. This SONY implementation of the ANDROID OS is very easy to get used to. I can prioritize and reorganize my favorite streams and receive a very easy-to-use programming management controlled by the well designed remote control. Visually and logically, SONY has matched the best TV operating systems out there. Operational speed and fluidity needs some work.The SONY manages my attached audio system via the remote and some eliminates the need for supplemental remotes. The operating system hesitates occasionally and seems sluggish compared to my other streaming OSs, but I’m going to predict SONY will provide some updates.SUMMARY: I don’t think the SONY Bravia XR A90J can be bested by any other TV on the market this year. I’m betting it will be difficult for SONY to improve on this TV’s picture quality for another few years. This may be the only TV I’ve owned for decades where I’ll forgo a professional calibration. It’s spectacular as is. Easy to recommend if you want the best TV on the market in 2021. This is a TV that makes movie theaters irrelevant, unless you prefer coughing, chattering crowds. Sit closer if you want your field of view filled.

With some slight adjustments and a good source, the picture is stunning. I also purchased two A80J's and have been equally Impressed, If like me, you have waited to invest in OLED technology and maybe hold on to your plasma screens because of the blacks and natural tones, give these a viewing. Expensive, yes, but if the A90J push your budget too far, take a look at the A80J's as an alternative.

I researched large screen TVs and read all the reviews, this Sony 84\" A90J was well reviewed, and I can say after 4 weeks, this TV is sensational. The Good Guys were fantastic to deal with, COVID lockdown meant I couldnt go to their store and see the TV and deal with the sales rep in person. The sales rep at Penrith answered all my questions and gave me the best deal of any other retailer on this TV. We have purchased many appliances from The Good Guys and their service and pricing is always the best. Delivery was also quick, the day after I paid. I have a 7.1 surround sound system, the unique feature of this TV is you can use the TV as a centre channel from the speaker connection of the surround sound processor, this is a huge and necessary improvement over a centre speaker placed under the TV. I have been watching the Netflix series Hyperdrive which is filmed at an industrial estate at night under lights, this TV excels with this type of program, blacks and colours are just amazing. The picture quality of this TV surpassed all my expectations, movies, TV, home videos, this TV produces an amazing picture and TV watching experience. The only negative about this TV is it uses Google TV and despite switching every conceivable setting off, I cant get rid of the paid streaming service advertising on the home screen which Googles Android TV bombards you with. I didnt pay thousands of dollars for a TV to get paid advertising which I cant switch off or disable. Government regulators really need to crack down on Google and others and legislate to stop these global companies from forcing advertising which I dont want and breaches my consumer rights to privacy. The other grip I have is with Sony Australia Support, I reached out to them for some assistance with setting up my TV and the dreaded Google TV adds. Despite lodging several support tickets and repeated phone calls, I didnt receive any support or assistance from Sony Australia. Reading reviews, this is a common compliant and I found thousands of posts on forums and review web sites complaining about Sony Australia lack of customer support and not responding to support requests. I spent thousands of dollars on one of their TVs and the least any consumer can expect is at the minimum, 30 days free technical support if assistance is required with setting up the TV.Again, I wish Government regulators would crack down on business who provide poor or no aftersales customer support and Sony Australia is the worst I have ever come across. I have even taken to write to Sony Corporation in Japan alerting them the unacceptable and poor aftersales customer service of Sony Australia.If the above two issues are a concern for you, try LG as I know their customer support and aftersales assistance is pretty good and far better than Sony Australia. Retailers such as The Good Guys also have responsibility here, as the point of sale for Sony products, they should complain to Sony Australia about their poor aftersales customer service and get them to fix it or refused to sell their products, if all retailers did this, maybe Sony Australia would wake up to them selves and fix this poor customer service model.","title":"Fantastic big screen TV"},{"date":"2021-07-02T16:17:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-24T00:10:38.460Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"I am so happy with my new purchase xrA90J -65 inch is the best oled tv ever its bright enough amazing images calibration right out of the box, I would recommend it to people who loves watching movies and if you plan not going to the movies for some time you should get the 83 inch no regrets I assure you ps.you'll love Bravia Core very clear","title":"No regrets","username":"Nawno"},{"date":"2021-04-01T02:45:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-04-10T12:45:52.197Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":2,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"This TV is perfect!

If you think to yourself 90 inches is too big, trust me, it is not. I got it home and after 1 day I was convinced it is the perfect size. Super easy to set up, and google tv is such an intuitive interface to use. The remote is quality and the self lit feature when you pick it up is something every TV should have. No TV is perfect though or else there would only be one supplier. My 1 and only negative point that stops it from being perfect is the fact it can only bluetooth pair with 1 headphone at time. When I want to watch with my wife when my kids are asleep I have had to buy extra gear which is annoying as it should be a built in feature. Hopefully Sony hears this and fixes in a future firmware update. It would make this Sony TV super fan very happy.

But when I booted this new Sony Bravia XR OLED up, the Google app offered to set everything up for me. A few minutes later everything was up. WOW! So then I quickly went to anything I could find with flaming lava or fluorescent colors. Not only was the lava glowing, but the contrasting black was solid! The only negative I could possibly find was that my old favorite animations that used to look great, now show obvious definitions between the animated characters and the background. I'll take that in a heartbeat. Finally, the audio actually projects through the screen.

Features for gaming, has hdmi 2.1 for next gen gaming. A ton of pucture customizations while in game mode. The cons, not very many. If you don't have a room with light control you will notice reflections on the screen. Would prefer 4 2.1 hdmi ports instead of 2. But, there is a work around when a splitter or 2.1 hdmi receiver becomes available. Lack of VRR at the moment, but Sonys says in the works winter 2021. CROSSING FINGERS. while playing in 4k 120 fps hdr, there is some noticeable banding in games that can be distracting. Hopefully there will soon be a fix (That part is why a 5 star wasn't provided). I stuck with Sony even after the debacle with Sony x900h on purchasing the A90J .Now my x900h is sitting in a closet collecting dust with a 4 year protection plan purchased through Sony . So Sony hear me out, PLEASE, figure out the issue with the 4k 120 fps hdr banding issue. The LG c1 and g1 doesn't have this problem. If no resolution then my next purchase may be with your competitor LG. So anyways this tv must buy for movie watching an almost there for next gen gaming . If Sony got creative an added some type of game optimization feature this tv would be untouchable from its competitors. Wish Sony would take gaming serious especially since they do own the playstation division. Maybe they should hire a Phil Spencer type person over there to get creative. Anyways hope this helps people on their decision to buy or not to buy.

Unfortunately, while the picture has been excellent so far, the much touted sound and Google TV apps have been a fail.Every other day or so, I find I must unplug this television and do a hard reset. For whatever reason, it simply locks up and you can't do anything but restart it. Doing so from the remote doesn't fix the issue very often, so the default has become to unplug it.We've cut the cable at our house, using only fiber optic internet and the available options for streaming services. This has really shown the weakness of Google TV, in my opinion. We subscribe to several services, including YouTubeTV, but the integration of services is severely lacking. Time and time again, I have to re-enter app info, after having to uninstall and reinstall bundled packaged apps. There is also a severe shortage of available storage space on the television. There doesn't appear to be a way to increase it with USB or SD cards that is readily acknowledged anywhere on Sony's site or in the television's literature, either. I'm fairly certain the limited storage available, coupled with adding shows, movies, and scheduled recordings to your library quickly leads to a locked TV.I keep hoping for a firmware update that will address both the lockups and storage issue, but nothing thus far. And if you search the forums and scan the web, many people are experiencing the same issues.And finally, the sound that was so perfect in the store model simply doesn't even exist on the unit in my home.

Even the two options for using the stand was a well thought out aesthetic decision. Picture quality is beyond beautiful.

The picture quality will blow your mind, you’ve never truly experienced a movie; a tv show; or a video game until you’ve watched/played it on this tv. The color black in picture, alone is perfect, the most opaque-true black I’ve ever seen on a screen. Oh, and can’t forget to mention the remote control — it’s a huge improvement! The top is a nice smooth aluminum, and the buttons light-up, so no more turning on a lamp to find the button you’re looking for. Plus, the remote works well with Apple TV. The only qualm I have is with handling the tv— Moving it is a bit stressful, as it’s a bit challenging to lift, not because it’s heavy, but because it’s tough to avoid grabbing the screen. Sony warns that you shouldn’t lay the screen down, even when attaching a wall mount.

So, that means my most recent TV was an LG OLED. It’s hard to believe that this SONY OLED, using LGs next generation panel could be so far advanced. This is a breakthrough. Before I break down some features I can assure anyone using the first few iterations of the LG panels that this one is a huge leap ahead. You need decide if it’s worth the considerable expense, but perfection does have a price.PICTURE: Out of the box, using the CUSTOM PICTURE MODE, and following the advice of a few of the online TV review gurus for a few settings, the picture that results is stunning. Rich saturated colors stand out and contrast that ranges from velvety blacks to almost blinding highlights set the goalposts for the competition impossibly high. You’ll read some online reviews complaining that you really need XXX number of NITS (measurement of brightness) to be really able to exploit HDR programing. Good grief. Unless you want to wear sunglasses to watch your favorite shows the SONY is startlingly bright enough. Shadows are handled perfectly and variations of shade in dark scenes as well are areas of brightly lit sky have smooth gradation, zero stair-stepping, and a range of contrast that can not be matched by most other TVs.ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM: I’m a huge fan of both the APPLE OS and the ROKU OS for managing streaming and live programming. This SONY implementation of the ANDROID OS is very easy to get used to. I can prioritize and reorganize my favorite streams and receive a very easy-to-use programming management controlled by the well designed remote control. Visually and logically, SONY has matched the best TV operating systems out there. Operational speed and fluidity needs some work.The SONY manages my attached audio system via the remote and some eliminates the need for supplemental remotes. The operating system hesitates occasionally and seems sluggish compared to my other streaming OSs, but I’m going to predict SONY will provide some updates.SUMMARY: I don’t think the SONY Bravia XR A90J can be bested by any other TV on the market this year. I’m betting it will be difficult for SONY to improve on this TV’s picture quality for another few years. This may be the only TV I’ve owned for decades where I’ll forgo a professional calibration. It’s spectacular as is. Easy to recommend if you want the best TV on the market in 2021. This is a TV that makes movie theaters irrelevant, unless you prefer coughing, chattering crowds. Sit closer if you want your field of view filled.

The Good Guys were fantastic to deal with, COVID lockdown meant I couldnt go to their store and see the TV and deal with the sales rep in person. The sales rep at Penrith answered all my questions and gave me the best deal of any other retailer on this TV. We have purchased many appliances from The Good Guys and their service and pricing is always the best. Delivery was also quick, the day after I paid. I have a 7.1 surround sound system, the unique feature of this TV is you can use the TV as a centre channel from the speaker connection of the surround sound processor, this is a huge and necessary improvement over a centre speaker placed under the TV. I have been watching the Netflix series Hyperdrive which is filmed at an industrial estate at night under lights, this TV excels with this type of program, blacks and colours are just amazing. The picture quality of this TV surpassed all my expectations, movies, TV, home videos, this TV produces an amazing picture and TV watching experience. The only negative about this TV is it uses Google TV and despite switching every conceivable setting off, I cant get rid of the paid streaming service advertising on the home screen which Googles Android TV bombards you with. I didnt pay thousands of dollars for a TV to get paid advertising which I cant switch off or disable. Government regulators really need to crack down on Google and others and legislate to stop these global companies from forcing advertising which I dont want and breaches my consumer rights to privacy. The other grip I have is with Sony Australia Support, I reached out to them for some assistance with setting up my TV and the dreaded Google TV adds. Despite lodging several support tickets and repeated phone calls, I didnt receive any support or assistance from Sony Australia. Reading reviews, this is a common compliant and I found thousands of posts on forums and review web sites complaining about Sony Australia lack of customer support and not responding to support requests. I spent thousands of dollars on one of their TVs and the least any consumer can expect is at the minimum, 30 days free technical support if assistance is required with setting up the TV.Again, I wish Government regulators would crack down on business who provide poor or no aftersales customer support and Sony Australia is the worst I have ever come across. I have even taken to write to Sony Corporation in Japan alerting them the unacceptable and poor aftersales customer service of Sony Australia.If the above two issues are a concern for you, try LG as I know their customer support and aftersales assistance is pretty good and far better than Sony Australia. Retailers such as The Good Guys also have responsibility here, as the point of sale for Sony products, they should complain to Sony Australia about their poor aftersales customer service and get them to fix it or refused to sell their products, if all retailers did this, maybe Sony Australia would wake up to them selves and fix this poor customer service model. Less","title":"Fantastic big screen TV","username":"anonymous · Review provided by  thegoodguys.com.au"},{"date":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2022-05-09T15:40:00.000Z","rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4374426724591181826/reviews"],"text":"Pros: I like being able to talk to the tv via “He Google” and ask the set to perform various functions.Cons: When searching programmes through the tv guide it would be useful to get detailed programme information while in this function.

Doing so from the remote doesn't fix the issue very often, so the default has become to unplug it.We've cut the cable at our house, using only fiber optic internet and the available options for streaming services. This has really shown the weakness of Google TV, in my opinion. We subscribe to several services, including YouTubeTV, but the integration of services is severely lacking. Time and time again, I have to re-enter app info, after having to uninstall and reinstall bundled packaged apps. There is also a severe shortage of available storage space on the television. There doesn't appear to be a way to increase it with USB or SD cards that is readily acknowledged anywhere on Sony's site or in the television's literature, either. I'm fairly certain the limited storage available, coupled with adding shows, movies, and scheduled recordings to your library quickly leads to a locked TV.I keep hoping for a firmware update that will address both the lockups and storage issue, but nothing thus far. And if you search the forums and scan the web, many people are experiencing the same issues.And finally, the sound that was so perfect in the store model simply doesn't even exist on the unit in my home.

Wifi is not an option, especially when using HT-A9 hometheater, because of the constant RF channels interference from Wifi routers. It only gets worse for those living in condos with tons of wifi routers nearby. Thankfully, I was able to work around that with Plug & Play USB to Ethernet Adapter to get to the Gigabit Ethernet. Sony please spend $5 more to upgrade to 1G port on Master series television.Also, while you are at it.

The 55 was the biggest I could afford of this model, but the A90J series is just best in class.

I liked the Tv a lot and the color was amazing but the TV was too dim for my taste. This TV is significantly brighter!! This TV is able to push it panel a lot further than LGs due to Sony putting a heat stance behind the panel to reduce the heat. The Cognitive XR processor is next level. The processor picks and choose what to upscale based on what the human eye would focus on and it’s very noticeable!! This Tv definitely costs a pretty penny but if you are looking for the best of the best...this is it. Also Sony has introduced their own streaming platform called Bravia Core.

I have six windows in my living room and it is bright during the day and have no issues seeing the TV on standard picture settings. I found Vivid picture settings to even be to bright. On HDR content at night I had to turn the brightness down because it was way to bright and hurting my eyes. I could not imagen having a TV doing 2000nits+ because it would burn your eyeballs out. The A90j is plenty bright during the day for any occasion and I would almost say it can be too bright at night if you want it to get there. The google TV makes it so easy to find shows and content. I have been trying to find a complaint about this TV for the week that I have had it and have not been able to.

It’s was incredibly distracting especially while watching hockey. The second panel had the same issues as well as dead pixels. The third was finally acceptable, however there is still a faint “grid” pattern visible in really bright scenes. This seems to be some type of inherent issue with the technology. Not something that I expected from their “master series”. Third, the TV comes in a box that looks like a 3rd grader put together. Not a huge deal, but for a premium price I’d expect a premium packaging. People don’t wrap diamond rings in paper bags...If you buy this tv make sure to check for the banding issues and the “grid” pattern as some panels seem to be worse than others.Aside from the screen uniformity issues, I really enjoy watching movies on this tv.

The A90J is bright even during the day in our living room with 6 windows, (3) ~8-10 feet to the left, and (3) more just behind my seating area 10-12 feet from the screen depending how far out the TV is positioned using the wall mount. It was a bit pricey at $4999 but considering how much time you spend sitting in front of it I still see it as a good value. I will be purchasing the Geek Squad 5 year extended warranty as it includes all TV services in my home which is MUCH preferred to having to remove the TV from the wall and deliver the the massive TV to a Sony service center hours away. It is worth noting the in home Geek Squad insurance kicks in after the Sony 1 year warranty expires meaning the in home service is for years 2-5. The insurance can be purchased in the first 60 days after purchase, and paid all at once or buy the month. I still need to hook up my Yamaha reliever and Polk speakers to the TV. Once completed I'll have a Dolby Atmos speaker system which will greatly enhance my viewing experience. Today I purchased the Sonance - MAG Series 8\" 2-Way In-Ceiling Speakers (Pair) - Paintable WhiteModel:MAG8R SKU:6342750 - which will complete my Dolby Atmos speaker setup. The Sonance speakers, regularly $999, were $700 off! I can't wait to enjoy the visual and audio experience together. As for now, the TV speakers are very good on their own.

And I still prefer Google TV as my OS.Even though the LG G2 has brighter HDR peaks, the overall APL (Average Picture Level) is still brighter on the A90J and its boosting of the all the colored sub pixels, not just white, still give it a saturation edge over the G2.S95B has a beautiful panel, but Tizen is a mess, and the video processing and motion processing are too aggressive and lead to more visible artifacting in tests I’ve seen. A90J handles SDR and HDR/DV material excellently and accurately. I’m amazed at how much more punch HDR has over my previous CX and A80J. That heatsink does wonders. You will notice it coming from any other 2021 or older OLED model. And image retention is virtually non-existent, thanks again to the heat sink.The built-in Acoustic sound is still the best in the industry, though it can’t compete with a high-end soundbar or full surround system, but will suffice for the apartment dweller or casual movie/tv viewer.Bottom-line is, if you’re cinephile, and can’t afford the A95K, the A90J is the best overall performing high-end TV of 2022, especially with the latest price drop.If you have to have the latest gaming features, go LG G2 or S95B. For everyone else, A90J is the way to go. Less","title":"Outside of QD-OLED, A90J is Still the King","username":"JamesF · Review provided by  bestbuy.com"},{"date":"2021-04-01T07:15:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-04-10T12:45:52.225Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":3,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"It is a great tv set but for the price there are other good ones to choose","title":"Good","username":"Kalpha"},{"date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2022-07-15T15:15:00.000Z","rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1617365-REG/sony_xr65a90j_bravia_xr_master_series.html"],"text":"I have owned this TV for 1 year.

I researched large screen TVs and read all the reviews, this Sony 84\" A90J was well reviewed, and I can say after 4 weeks, this TV is sensational. The Good Guys were fantastic to deal with, COVID lockdown meant I couldnt go to their store and see the TV and deal with the sales rep in person. The sales rep at Penrith answered all my questions and gave me the best deal of any other retailer on this TV. We have purchased many appliances from The Good Guys and their service and pricing is always the best. Delivery was also quick, the day after I paid. I have a 7.1 surround sound system, the unique feature of this TV is you can use the TV as a centre channel from the speaker connection of the surround sound processor, this is a huge and necessary improvement over a centre speaker placed under the TV. I have been watching the Netflix series Hyperdrive which is filmed at an industrial estate at night under lights, this TV excels with this type of program, blacks and colours are just amazing. The picture quality of this TV surpassed all my expectations, movies, TV, home videos, this TV produces an amazing picture and TV watching experience. The only negative about this TV is it uses Google TV and despite switching every conceivable setting off, I cant get rid of the paid streaming service advertising on the home screen which Googles Android TV bombards you with. I didnt pay thousands of dollars for a TV to get paid advertising which I cant switch off or disable. Government regulators really need to crack down on Google and others and legislate to stop these global companies from forcing advertising which I dont want and breaches my consumer rights to privacy. The other grip I have is with Sony Australia Support, I reached out to them for some assistance with setting up my TV and the dreaded Google TV adds. Despite lodging several support tickets and repeated phone calls, I didnt receive any support or assistance from Sony Australia. Reading reviews, this is a common compliant and I found thousands of posts on forums and review web sites complaining about Sony Australia lack of customer support and not responding to support requests. I spent thousands of dollars on one of their TVs and the least any consumer can expect is at the minimum, 30 days free technical support if assistance is required with setting up the TV.Again, I wish Government regulators would crack down on business who provide poor or no aftersales customer support and Sony Australia is the worst I have ever come across. I have even taken to write to Sony Corporation in Japan alerting them the unacceptable and poor aftersales customer service of Sony Australia.If the above two issues are a concern for you, try LG as I know their customer support and aftersales assistance is pretty good and far better than Sony Australia. Retailers such as The Good Guys also have responsibility here, as the point of sale for Sony products, they should complain to Sony Australia about their poor aftersales customer service and get them to fix it or refused to sell their products, if all retailers did this, maybe Sony Australia would wake up to them selves and fix this poor customer service model. Less","title":"Fantastic big screen TV","username":"anonymous · Review provided by  thegoodguys.com.au"},{"date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2024-06-19T09:10:43.133Z","didPurchase":"true","id":"R2KZBEEAXLQIIA","numHelpful":3,"sourceURLs":["https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QXHYQFQ?productDetails&th=1&psc=1"],"text":"Expensive but worth it.

You remove two white inserts and the box lifts off without needing to move the TV. The instructions make it easy to follow as you peel off layer by layer leaving you with the TV. The main thing to install is the legs and there are three positions to choose from, depending on if you have a soundbar. The TV looks and sounds great. The picture is 4K HDR and has really good viewing angles. We used to rotate our previous TV when viewing from our kitchen, but there's no need here. The TV is also incredibly thin, it's hard to tell it's even there from the side. We don't have a soundbar so have been using the TV speakers. It sounds great with some good bass coming from just the TV and sound being cast around the room. You can really just use the TV speakers if you want. The TV uses Google TV for its OS, which is my preference. I think it's the best current TV OS available. It has good recommendation, has every app we use, and saves what we watch. And for the screensaver, it shows our family photos. Overall this is an amazing TV and I see us using it for years.

Sometimes it's named with your assigned name, sometimes with the detected name of the device (why?).-- Inputs always auto-select, so turning on a device changes to that input. No choice, no questions, no ability to NOT have this .. the TV just does it, because reasons?-- Audio output is a mess. You can output audio via optical, TV speakers, or eARC, but there is no obvious way to simply choose how you want audio out. Intend the TV tries to be smart and detect what it should do. Which it gets wrong if (e.g.) your eARC device is not on. And the choice of audio output is obscured under menus that try to make smart selections, and get it wrong.-- Oh, and if you use optical audio out, you have to turn the TV volume down. No setting to mute this or switch to optical only. Really bad design.For example, by BD player has eARC, and I use its audio output to my audio system. So all I need to play TV sound is to enable eARC, and get sound via that, right?Nope! Because when I turn on my BD player, the TV switches video to the BD player, which disables eARC on the DB player, which stops audio playing. All because the TV thinks it is being smart when in fact its being dumb.So, IF and WHEN you can get the TV to display the input you want, it looks great, but be prepared to FIGHT with the terrible menus and confused dumb intelligence of Google TV artificial dumbness. Less","title":"Great Video Quality Marred by Google TV Horrors","username":"Tim · Review provided by  bhphotovideo.com"},{"date":"2021-04-09T16:15:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-06-20T13:21:14.403Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":2,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"The colors and quality is very excillent blew what i expected it to be out of the water.

This is the first time I have purchased a tv this expensive and I didn't want to buy one that I would regret later on. From the moment I opened the box and set the TV, I have been completely satisfied. The picture quality is phenomenal, the sound quality is fantastic, and the user interface is extremely smooth.1. Picture: Picture quality is vivid and provides details that were missed or easily looked over when watching on an older tv. As a part of Sony's Master Series, all TVs are professionally calibrated prior to leaving the factory. This prevents the owner from wasting time trying to perfect the image quality. With the use of new computer processing, the TV has the ability to adjust itself according to the lighting atmosphere at the moment it is being viewed. OLED makes a world of difference when viewing content. Whites are whiter and blacks are deeper, without losing the ability to see everything else happening.2. Sound: The audio produced from this tv has the ability to provide the quality of sound in comparison to a 5.1 sound system. Previously I had a premium 3.1.2 sound bar w/ a subwoofer connected to my older TV and I thought it produced amazing sound. Once I heard the sound quality on this TV, there was no way I could replace it with my sound bar. With the computer programming, it has the capability of monitoring the sound in the room and adjusting it according to where you are sitting. I find myself having to turn down the volume when my kids are sleeping, so they aren't awoken by the action or suspenseful scenes in a movie.3. User Interface: I have to point first and foremost, the smoothness transition from app to app or when scrolling through different contents is far superb from all other TVs. I find myself hating when I am using my other TVs because of how sluggish they are. When setting up the TV to add all of the apps I have access to, I initially found myself feeling as if it was a little more complex than it truly is. After scrolling through, I was able to navigate effortlessly, without any complications.4. Casting: I have used Google's Chromecast Dongles in the past and they were always problematic with remaining connected. The casting feature on the TV works without any issues and remains stable throughout its connection.With over 2 weeks of use, I am impressed and happy with the purchase of the Sony A90J 55 Inch TV. I will periodically return and provide an update to the overall use. If you are on the fence about this TV, I recommend researching this TV among others within its class and then make your decision. If you are still interested in this TV, I can say without a doubt you will be satisfied with your purchase.","title":"WOW!

This can't be overcome as the brightness is already on Max. This is also worrying for the long term if the OLED screen loses any brightness over time.Sound quality is really great, clear voices & punchy when expected (if using the standard setting & avoiding the \"enhanced\" options - which cause voices to become less clear & bass to distort) & is 1 of the main reasons I chose this version.

A pleasant and unexpected surprise.I did have trouble connecting to a hardwired ethernet cable. Not sure what the problem was, but Sony customer service was very helpful and patient in trying to resolve the issue, even to the point of offering to exchange the TV. In desperation, I tried the same thing I tried 3 or 4 times before and it worked. I have noticed that physically disconnecting and reconnecting the ethernet cable is problematic, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I initially chalked this up to issues with the connector, but I tried at 3 different cables that all were working with my old setup and the same cables sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. However once connected I've not had a problem; it does maintain the connection.My biggest criticism is with the remote. I could quibble about the button placement. The mute button is tiny, something use we a lot, There are no page buttons, so scrolling 1 item at a time is tedious. These are design trade-offs, so I understand you can't have every thing. But the real issue is the extreme directionality of the IR. Off axis by 30-45 degrees and it is unresponsive. Contrast this with the XFINITY remote which works in almost any place in the room and pointed in almost any random direction. I am going to try adding an IR blaster, but the XFINITY remote shows this can be done without extra junk. Less","title":"Fantastic TV, Quibbles with the Remote","username":"JimR · Review provided by  Best Buy"},{"date":"2021-04-16T19:51:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-08-31T14:49:42.885Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":3,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"We had purchased SONY TVs my entire life until three years ago when we bought a competing brand which was one of the worst decisions in my life.

The picture is beautiful right out of the box, however, it’s difficult to see in bright sunlight. Ours happens to be mounted near a window and when the sun peeks through the window and lights up the room, the screen has a tremendous glare.

The XR processor really improves the image, especially from subpar sources such as cable tv and low resolution content. HDR is very bright for an oled. It is 1300 in the useless vivid mode and about 825 nits out of the box according to my colorimeter and using the Calman software in the accurate \"custom\" mode. With a couple of tricks that are available in the forums and on youtube, I was able to reach over 900 nits without sacrificing any accuracy at all which is simply amazing! This translates to the best HDR experience ever. Yes, LEDs can get brighter but perceived brightness starts a full black which no LED can ever do. The combination of the perfect black level, class leading brightness, pixel level light control and stellar shadow detail thanks to the XR processor result in the best HDR image ever seen in a consumer television. There are a couple of cons with this tv, such as the built in youtube app does not display the proper color space in certain HDR clips. The auto color space setting gets stuck in BT709 and you have to manually go in and change it, but thankfully this is only an issue with the built in youtube app. Another issue there is a Dolby Vision mismatch with a couple of external streamers such as Roku, firestick and chromecast. However, most external streaming devices and 4k bluray players wont exhibit this issue, as apple tv, nvidia shield, Panasonic ub820 4k blu ray player all have flawless Dolby Vision with this tv. Despite these minor flaws, I am still giving this work of art 5 stars since it currently offers the best available picture quality on the mark, and furthermore, all TVs will have minor flaws or quirks here and there. There is no such thing as a perfect TV, but this is as close as anything has ever approached in my honest opinion.","title":"A JAW DROPPING, STUNNING MASTERPIECE!","username":"Tony"},{"date":"2021-05-21T18:31:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-09-10T01:16:59.222Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"The TV is fantastic, but I do have one complaint.They did not give me a receipt for my purchase.

OLED tvs. I don’t think there’s many of these around now, but if you get a chance grab one, it’s a Truly stunningly TV and the fact you can use it as a centre channel for a proper AV set up is great. Even the remote which is quite long is well built. Doesn’t flex doesn’t Creek and the fact that it has a gentle backseat key set up when moved is perfect. It’s just bright enough to say at night time without being glaringly bright. It’s a shame they couldn’t have included a slightly smaller remote. The new one is being. I think I did a bit better but it’s also quite nice to have almost every six conceivable button on one remote control anyway, which is very slim and very light and so much better than the old plastic remotes. I was glad I managed to get one of these. It’s a perfect set for my needs works brilliantly with the PS5 Google TV. Well the interface is a bit cluttered but you can cut that back and Bravia core has so much detail, but the file sizes are quite large so you need a good Internet connection. All in all there isn’t much difference between this TV and the ones coming out this year. In fact I would say this one is probably better built than some of the newer ones which use soft plastic. The A90J you could say was definitely over built but that’s not a bad thing at all the current prices it’s a bargain and you won’t really notice any difference. Compare with the current sets Sony are pushing out this year it’s just a shame they’re still stuck on Android 10. It be nice to see this and if you have a set upgraded to android 11 or 12. The only thing that lets it down is a rather cluttered interface and a lack of information about what every single setting does. Unlike most android products there seems to be so many ways to get to the same place. I can get a bit confusing at times, but once you get used to it end navigation is so far through the menus it’s a joy to use and put a grin on my face when I sit back and watch it in the evening or game on it during the day. Custom is probably the best setting and personally under clarity, I do use reality creation on auto it’s almost free do you like and the extra detail that AI puts into the image is quite incredible. Detail without over.

What is worse is that Samsung would not honor their warranty on 65” Q90T QLED 4K claiming the damage was done during installation and refusing to recognize that they delivered and set it up. So far, I am pleased with my Sony and continue to post about my experiences with Samsung. Keep your customers happy, and they will always return.","title":"Better than Samsung"},{"date":"2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2022-02-06T18:58:00.000Z","rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1617365-REG/sony_xr65a90j_bravia_xr_master_series.html"],"text":"Ok… let’s get this out of the way.

We are both enjoying movie time and even just watching regular tv in a whole new light! In addition to the tv being in a league of its own I am equally impressed with the Google TV as well as the remote that comes with the Bravia. The remote easily pairs with your cable box and has pre built buttons for DISNEY, YOUTUBE, NETFLIX and PRIME VIDEO making it a VERY USER FRIENDLY TV UNIVERSAL REMOTE! Anyone on the fence not sure if your going to be making a wise purchase I can SAFELY say this Bravia Television has totally met and exceeded my expectations on what a TV can do!!!

It brings with it lots of films in a mixture of HD, 4K, 4K HDR and 4K IMAX Enhanced. The latter, is unbelievable and has to be seen to be believed, as it brings out a rich vibrancy in select movies. I watched Spiderman Away From Home in 4K IMAX Enhanced, luckily I have a Denon receiver that had IMAX Enhanced sound, and I was amazed at the sound and vision coming into perfect unison, to create one of the best experiences I have ever had watching a movie.The built in Google TV operating system is quick and responsive, my only gripe is that it does not show anything I have partly watched from Netflix, so that I may resume watching them without first having to go to the Netflix app.The settings system itself is excellent, with changing settings on the fly very quick and easy to do, with good descriptions of each option.The sound system of the TV is really good, although I have not tested it much as I have a receiver that is far more capable.The remote: I had a previous Sony Bravia LCD/LED TV and it's remote was too heavy and had far too many buttons. The remote for this TV is breath of fresh air: it is light, has fewer buttons, has four excellent quick access buttons to Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, and is back lit so you can see the buttons in the dark.Since my initial purchase, I have not regretted one moment what I paid for this TV, and believe me it was not cheap. IMHO, worth every penny - especially as it comes pre-calibrated, and the heat-sink alone is worth the extra; just to have the piece of mind that there is not likely to be any burn-in issues.Con: There is only one negative, I would have to say that it only comes in the fact that the blacks tend to be very dark and possibly crushing just a little bit of the detail, but I cannot be sure of this.In one word, for me, the TV is 'Perfect!'.(there is no perfect TV really, but this TV sure does come very close...) Less","title":"Sony has finally done it!","username":"KindAngelofGod · Review provided by  sony.co.uk"},{"date":"2021-04-26T20:49:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-27T12:30:16.830Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":5,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480","http://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/sony-65-class-bravia-xr-a90j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6450480"],"text":"Compared to an average flat panel TV, the speakers on this thing are absolutely ridiculous! I took the plunge with this TV for the possibility that I wouldn't need to use a sound bar with it. I really wanted to minimize the wires and accessories attached to the mounted TV. Feature lists for TV's are often full of total over hype on basically everything (especially the sound features). I was not holding my breath that the sound would actually be as good or better than a very good sound bar, but it is- easily. I knocked off one star because the price is kind of scary. I am also slightly intimidated to use the TV because it was so expensive. The OLED display looks absolutely dazzling, but the minute risk of burn in is utterly frightening after what I paid for this thing. I just worry too much probably. Features that work great and I often use on it are Chromecast, SteamLink, and playing media off my network storage. I have not had a satisfactory experience with AirPlay yet, but I don't know if that is the TV's fault. The TV looks and sounds amazing in my home.

This is my third Sony TV I have purchased from Amazon and the fourth Sony TV I have owned.The first one I purchased from Amazon was a Bravia XBR HD in 2001. My in-laws currently have that TV and the picture still looks good. Yes, Sony TVs generally cost more than the other brands but its worth paying a premium price for a TV that has not only excellent picture quality and sound quality but also reliability and longevity.Many reviewers suggest using the custom setting for the picture mode, but in this mode through my eyes the colors look dull. I like the vivid mode, in this mode the colors are more vibrant and life like. For example, watching the Netflix movie All Quiet On The Western Front feels like I was standing there as a spectator. Thats how amazing the picture quality is and yes, the sound quality is also amazing too.You want another reason why you should purchase this TV The price! Because this model is a 2021 the price has been heavily marked down by Amazon. In case your wondering, no, the TV was not manufactured in 2021 The year 2021 is when the model first became available. For example, my Sony A90J TV was manufactured in September, 2022.I say, if you can afford this TV go for it.

Since it is sensitive to motion, just bumping it causes the cursor to pop up on the screen. I don't see a way to add a delay or disable the cursor.

While it is a VESA standard (300mm x 200mm), it didn't fit onto my wall mount because my mounting arms could not come narrow enough to mount to the TV. I had to make an adapter plate to make it fit.

It was like, you want high refresh rate Then you dont have the image quality of 4K. You want 4K and 100hz Here it is, Ultrawide for you. BUT, you have glowing effect anyway.Im tired of the glowing effect.OLED B9 65 offers the best image quality VS LCD and you get G-SYNC 40-60fps for 4K60hz and low input lag and low motion Blur and a TV. You can use 1440p 120hz but I like real HDR 4K 4:4:4 even at 60hz.HDR games, movies and even Windows looks amazing.I play for hours in a row and dont worry about burn in. The panel have options to avoid this build in wallpaper transitions, screen shifting, logo brightness, pixel Refresher maintenance and if you add your windows screen saver it will protect your panel from static images. In a simple way, dont abuse the panel and if you walk away turn off the tv.For browsing, I resize or move the windows like normal from time to time. I use the automatic task bar hiding so is not there all the time.I play PUBG, Star Citizen, league of legends, tomb raider, The Witcher, etc. This LG OLED B9 is the friend of a high end PC and IMO gives the best gaming experience right now.If the HDMI 2.1 allows the option of 4K 120hz with future GPUs it will be even more amazing.The big one for LCD QLED Samsung is better brightness than OLED but it has this glowing effect than I cant take anymore. No matter how many dimming zones they put, there is glowing. So is not an option for me. Also more expensive than B9. Since my room is not that big and no big windows I feel like the extra brightness is not needed for me.The conclusion for my experience is, gaming monitors are good but looks like garbage aside of the OLED.","username":"Amazon Customer"},{"date":"2020-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2020-05-13T23:32:03.144Z","didPurchase":"false","id":"R2TCAIV53Y40RS","numHelpful":1,"rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RMSJT4J"],"text":"We love this tv! Weve only had it a week so keep this in mind. I will update anything if need be.The tv arrived on time and although there was some damage to the box the tv was in excellent condition. We bought the 55 model so its best to have two people to move the box, remove it from the packaging and position the tv. we used the stand on a swivel base. It is very sturdy when swinging the tv from one direction to another. If you have a habit of grasping the tv to swivel it you may have some issues because the thin Q screen will flex. We always grasp the swivel base to move the tv with no issues or wobbling.I think the first review you read with 5 stars written by Kaz says it better than I can. I am uninformed when it comes to these things, but I will provide what I can.The remote takes some getting used to as all of them do. We subscribe to Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and have directv. Set up for these was fast and intuitive. Now just a push of a button takes you to which ever you want, or there is an option on the remote labeled movies and all of them show the options in which you can search. We live in the north Georgia mountains so the tv antenna is out of the question so I cannot comment on that function. At this point I only have two considerations. 1) As you go through the different steps in changing settings a window will pop up with a very brief description on the topic you are looking at. I wish it would go into more detail or at least be provided in the instruction booklet. UPDATE: I just found the instructions within the set up options which do provide more detail, but in some areas they are still vague. I followed the set up tips in the first review I mentioned earlier and the picture is fantastic in a light or dark room. 2) The remote will not allow us to perform the basic functions associated with our directv such as display our list of recorded programs, record or record a series so we must keep two remotes out where as before we only needed one. these are just tick turds and I would highly recommend this tv!Ive read reviews that said the bass was to low. I experienced the opposite and therefore added treble and the sound is perfect. We never had external speakers or the like, but the sound from these internal speakers is fantastic, the best I have heard.Ive also read reviews regarding burn in or issues with the picture quality diminishing. I did have some reservations due to these reviews. Here is what Ive found - if you pause a program while in directv the screen will change to a changing set of pictures, while in other subscription modes the screen will turn black and provide a small fireworks display. These colorful bursts appear in different areas of the screen. The news channels we watch do have banners running across the bottom/side of the screen, but even they have gotten the word and change them up periodically. LG has a picture cleaning program (I do not recall the exact title) which is programmed to run periodically when the tv is turned off, I think this once annually or you can select it to be done manually if you have issues. So my worries are gone.We have no use for some features such as voice commands or Alexa so we didnt agree to the LG permissions. This only limits us from watching whatever LG offers on their channel. We feel safer this way. My son has an LG tv and he agreed to all of the permissions and found that he started receiving advertisements from Amazon based on conversations held in the room so he turned all of them off and those types of advertisements stopped. Just a warning when you set up your LG tv. If you dont mind others listening to you, check the agree to all otherwise just check the do it later option. We were aware of this prior to purchase so this is not an issue for us.","title":"Its night and day from our plasma tv","username":"Al"},{"date":"2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2020-05-13T23:32:03.145Z","didPurchase":"true","id":"R162P1S1YOMLP4","numHelpful":1,"rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RMSJT4J"],"text":"I wanted to buy this TV for a very long time. Every time I went to any tech store I would always casually walk by the TV section just to look at this TV. So, I finally pulled the trigger.The picture (and viewing angle) are incredible. The picture on the TV looks the same wether you are looking right at it or way off to the side. The contrast is incredible. I have the TV set up in a room with a rather large window and I have no issues seeing the picture when its sunny outside (glare and brightness).The speakers on this TV are easily the best TV speakers I have heard. The high range is crisp and has a solid mid-range. This wont compete with a sound bar and sub/full home theater set-up, but it'll get the job done.I also have an xbox one x and the 4k gameplay is unreal, combine that with the stark contrast the OLED panel provides and it is unparalleled.As far as burn-in goes... LG has software added in that will play a screen-saver of sorts to avoid this. Which is perfect if you play spotify/amazon music/fill in the blank from your TV.In sum, there is no doubt this TV is 2-3x more expensive than other TV's.... but it really is that much better. If you view purchasing a TV as an investment then this is one to make.PS: Once you watch this TV you will not want to watch anything on any other TV....","title":"Hella expensive...Hella worth it","username":"Jarett"},{"date":"2020-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2020-09-22T07:50:14.775Z","didPurchase":"true","id":"R3E51A6O6R5NJF","numHelpful":1,"rating":5.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RMSJT4J"],"text":"turn it on, you will be amazed","title":"unreal picture quality","username":"john w fisher"},{"date":"2020-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2020-05-13T23:32:03.144Z","didPurchase":"true","id":"RO91Z9ER9GV9R","rating":1.0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RMSJT4J"],"text":"Do not buy this TV.

We don't have room for a soundbar, but I did try computer speakers; because they only had 3.5mm inputs, I needed a digital audio converter to convert the digital signal from the optical out to an analog signal so they could output through the speakers. The sound was significantly improved with even a $16 pair of speakers from Amazon, but because I had used the DAC to connect the optical outputs to the speakers, the remote didn't control the speakers. I had to reach underneath the TV to a manual volume control on the wire connecting the speakers to each other, and unplug the speakers -- plugged in behind the TV -- to power them down. The hassle overrode the improved sound, and I resigned myself to weak audio.

We don't have room for a soundbar, but I did try computer speakers; because they only had 3.5mm inputs, I needed a digital audio converter to convert the digital signal from the optical out to an analog signal so they could output through the speakers. The sound was significantly improved with even a $16 pair of speakers from Amazon, but because I had used the DAC to connect the optical outputs to the speakers, the remote didn't control the speakers. I had to reach underneath the TV to a manual volume control on the wire connecting the speakers to each other, and unplug the speakers -- plugged in behind the TV -- to power them down.

I have two issues, one surmountable, the other, sadly, not. The easy one is that there's no USB port in back, so I can't power a Roku off the TV itself. A tap at the wall outlet solves that minor matter. The bigger concern is the quality of the audio. TV speakers are notoriously underpowered, and these seem to be worse than most. The TV is sitting on a granite countertop, which does nothing but reflect the sound, but we still need to raise the volume to about 75 (out of 100) to make out the dialogue in a show or movie. We don't have room for a soundbar, but I did try computer speakers; because they only had 3.5mm inputs, I needed a digital audio converter to convert the digital signal from the optical out to an analog signal so they could output through the speakers. The sound was significantly improved with even a $16 pair of speakers from Amazon, but because I had used the DAC to connect the optical outputs to the speakers, the remote didn't control the speakers. I had to reach underneath the TV to a manual volume control on the wire connecting the speakers to each other, and unplug the speakers -- plugged in behind the TV -- to power them down. The hassle overrode the improved sound, and I resigned myself to weak audio. Oh well - it's just a kitchen TV.","title":"Great picture, lacking sound"},{"date":"2021-10-20T13:53:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-10-27T12:26:44.537Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":1,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/lg-24-class-led-hd-smart-webos-tv/6337604"],"text":"TV is the right size for my kitchen.

The built in speakers do not put out enough volume, and the power plug is rather large (it does not \"share\" an outlet well). Neither is a deal breaker as I made some sound adjustments to improve the sound output ... a little. And we don't plug anything else into that outlet. The biggest disappointment is the operation of the Xfinity app. We don't have a cable plug anywhere near the TV location, so we really wanted to use the Xfinity app with a WiFi connection. Half the time it works great. The other half of the time it freezes and skips. I can stream Netflix with no problem, so it is probably not my Wifi.

It DOES NOT have the Apple TV app pre-installed for you to use. You have to access your subscription via the LG web browser AND watch it on the web browser as well.

It does keep trying to access the Apple TV app I already have installed on the Roku so that may be why. I also wish LG would have a dedicated app so I could download the remote control and view the apps I have installed, something similar to what Roku has.The other thing I notice is if I transfer the roku stick to another tv that is in close proximity, the lg tv will turn on by itself (not playing anything). I only notice it when I see the tv light up in the kitchen while I am watching on the other tv. I’ve found it’s been turned on by seeing the the green light on (dark screen). So I’ve started unplugging the lg tv when I’m not using it. I plan to buy another Roku stick to be used on the lg tv only to see if that will solve this issue.Also please update the log content store! It is so limited in what it has available to install.

I purchased this TV as a replacement for a non smart TV, specifically in order to use it for streaming services. The TV itself works well in that picture quality is good, and sound quality is as expected when watching cable TV. However, this TV falls short when streaming. It frequently freezes when trying to navigate to Prime TV. When using it with either Disney Plus or Prime, navigating to desired shows is quite cumbersome compared to the process on either my Ipad or another TV. Worst yet, is that for some reason sound volume is set much lower when streaming as compared to watching cable TV. In fact, I have to turn sound to 100% and it is still too soft. I don't have this problem when watching other TVs in my home or when using this TV for cable, so it is definitely a problem with using it for streaming and not my hearing. Most likely the problem could be fixed by purchasing a sound bar, but I shouldn't have to do that. Finally, when I purchased it in December 2020, it was NOT compatible with CBS All Access. I dropped the service so don't know whether the problem was fixed with subsequent updates.

Now, that too requires I use the two remotes. Of course am annoyed.Thanks for asking.I asked if I needed anything special to hook up the new tv. The salesmen said no. He said I should just use the same plug in hook-up i had with my old set. That was completely wrong. I had to visit Comcast to get a new box, cable and wiring. I also had to obtain instructions to set it up. It was difficult to get anyone to help me. No one would help me over the telephone. But then someone took pity and did so. Yet still had to get an appointment for someone to come to my home - which was many days forward. Finally, a Comcast repair person came out the following week, and set it up. It was hours wasted on the telephone getting all this accomplished!Now with the television working, there is another annoyance. I have to use 2 remotes each time I use it. The Comcast remote handles the turning on and off, plus the change of stations. The tv remote regulates the sound -- and it takes too long to do so.Over all, the purchase was an unpleasant experience, and the use of 2 remotes continues it. Less","title":"Annoyances Best Buy/TV Purchase Experience","username":"none · Review provided by  Best Buy"},{"date":"2021-01-28T17:37:00.000Z","dateSeen":"2021-02-13T21:36:33.493Z","doRecommend":"true","numHelpful":0,"sourceURLs":["https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/lg-24-class-led-hd-smart-webos-tv/6337604"],"text":"Awesome product for its price point.
